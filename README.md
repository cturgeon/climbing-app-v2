This is my rock cimbing app.
The goal is for users to record, track, and evaluate their climbing progress.

Much of the development is still in progress...

Up next:

- [ ] add context for screen width on route pages
- [ ] tune up climb log visuals

When I can get to it:

- [ ] change: route pics show the start, modal shows whole climb
- [ ] selecting (drawer, footer?) walls on route page

idk sometime in the future:

- [ ] delete functions for admin forms
- [ ] 'want-to-climb' list
- [ ] 4x4 with (climb selector, timers, more?...)
