This is my rock cimbing app.
The goal is for users to record, track, and evaluate their climbing progress.

Much of the development is still in progress...

Up next:

- [ ] comments feedback linked to database
- [ ] delete functions for admin forms
- [ ] thumbnails for climbs - click to enlarge
- [ ] 'want-to-climb' list
- [ ] 4x4 with (climb selector, timers, more?...)
